# Platform Overview

## Purpose
This portal is the internal operations documentation for the full stack:
- Laravel Admin
- Horizon queue workers
- Go control-plane and Go workers
- SG6 seed-send operations

## Operating Principle
- Keep one source of truth for runbooks and tuning.
- Change one high-risk setting at a time.
- Observe metrics for at least one full window before next change.
